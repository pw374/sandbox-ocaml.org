sandbox for the next <http://ocaml.org> with the new (2013) design

- `md-pages` is the directory where "MPP" Markdown files are.
  - Those are meant to be preprocessed with MPP to produce "pure" Markdown files. 
- `html-pages` is a directory that is *generated*. You're not supposed to put anything important inside because it may get deleted at anytime. (And it's not on Git, of course.) However it's *the* directory that contains the final ocaml.org website.
- `gen.bash` is the script that accepts (as arguments) `.md` files or directories that are `md-pages` or inside of it.
- `Makefile` is used by `gen.bash` to actually generate each `.html` page inside `html-pages`.
- `main_tpl.mpp` is the main template for generating the `.html` pages.
- ***undocumented files are either waiting to be documented, or deleted.***

-------------------------------
"MPP" Markdown means Markdown that needs to be processed with MPP
before being real Markdown.
